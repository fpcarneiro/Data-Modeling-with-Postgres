# Discuss the purpose of this database in the context of the startup, Sparkify, and their analytical goals.
As Data Engineer at Sparkify I desinged a star schema model to facilitate the processes of queriying the data about the habits of the users of our music platform. Before, such a task was rather complicated since the user activity was only stored in JSON files on user's devices. So it was really complicated gather and aggregate information about customers.
I modeled the database using the Star Schema Model. We have now one Fact table, "songplays" along with four more Dimension tables named "users", "songs", "artists" and "time". We have also developed an automated pipeline to transfer all the informations from JSON files to the tables of our model in Postgres using Python.

# State and justify your database schema design and ETL pipeline.
Because the star schema is denormalized, its structure provides fast agregations and simplified queries and this was everything the analytis team was looking for. As a result, we expect that from now on the task of querying the users data by the analytics team will be much more efficient and will help Sparkify to better know its users, making the company able to improve the experience of users and consequently become more lucrative.
